## Demo
We used server side validation to make sure data is entered correctly in the corresponding fields.

E-mail and password field validation is implemented using AJAX, validations are done in real time to check if e-mail is already registered and if passwords match.

Users can easily navigate between different cities. Clicking on any city leads to its corresponding city dashboard.

Users can add an activity, with the date being optional. They have to specify the city using a dropdown menu.

Users can view each activity to see more details. If this activity was added by them, they can edit or remove it. If not, they can only up-vote or down-vote.

Users can modify the information of activities they previously added. The same validations apply as when creating the activity.

Users can check their profile for content they added, and access this content to edit or remove it. They can also see the content they “up-voted” or liked.

Users have the option to receive a random activity in their desired city.
